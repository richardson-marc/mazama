last day; return to sender

We all awoke pretty early.  Most of us ambled over to the store for a 7am breakfast, and plans for a ride.  We had been thinking of a tear on Jack's trail, but this was a bit bumpy and rocky for cross bikes ( I has an awesome session on the fat bike), so we changed tack to head out to the rolling huts and back, about an hour tour.  It was a moderate pace heading out, but on the way back some of they guys started pushing the pace, and monkey see monkey do.  I was not really needing to kill myself for the last 1/2 hour, so I let them go, keeping them just in sight.  With just a few miles to go, the group made a turn I didn't see, and as there were several left trending paths, I just kept straight to the road, then took the road back to camp.  Arrived a bit ahead of everyone, we packed and got ready to leave.
