day 7 a day for the rouleurs

The ride started from Davo's in Winthrop.  Rode out, flat and rolling up gravel roads and singletrack for 10 miles before we hit the real uphill slope, a pretty well graded road.  It was not super steep, so I was able to hang on to the group.  The track gained elevation, lost, gained, and lost for a while, and I was able to hang on or at least close to the group for most of the climb.  A long decent, followed by a 400 foot climb, then another long decent, and a rolling route into the town of Twisp.  This was our scheduled lunch break, we got some sandwiches and coffee.  The plan was for a further climb up toward Sun Peak, and some single track up there before heading back.  I was cashed out and decided to head back.  Davo encouraged me to take a back road to his house.  It was a bit longer, but kept me off of the highway, which was a nice trade off.  This route broght me to the junction of Winthrop, so I continued into town, and stopped off at the brewery we had stopped in at a few days ago for a cold one.  That hit the spot, and got me off my feet for a bit.  Chatted with my server for a bit about the week, she was suprised that I was the only one of the group of 14 who thought knocking off early for a beer was better than riding another hour :).  I agreed, but set off for the last two miles onto Davo's.  Davo and Janet were there already!  Turns out El Chefe and El Hefe had turned out early as well, to get to their vehicle and get some dinner prepped.  Many thanks to them!  Waited for the rest of the group to filter in and get some rest, and we headed back to Mazama base camp to get cleaned up and ready for dinner, which was some amazing lazagna and meatballs from Patty (el Hefe's wife).  Another fun evening with the group...
