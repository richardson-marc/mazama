day 6 fat bike adventure

The crew was heading up to slaughter Starvation mountain (bone pic).  I opted out, as I was having a hard time on these long climbs.  Waved the group off, had a leasurely morning, then headed off to the Goat Beard to rent a bike.  Borrowed a fat bike, which lost air in the mile and a half back to the house, and more air on the way past the store.  So I traded it in for a new bike.  Took a ride past the inn, and up SR 100.  A long hour and a half climb, 2000 feet to the height-of-land.  A this point, it started down, and the road was blocked by a 4 foot diameter tree which had fallen across the road.  I turned back.  Without any cell phone network access, I had not Google Maps, and didn't realize how close I was to the end of a dead end road.  Would have been nice to hit the end, but the top of the climb was good enough.  Bombed down the decent back to the Inn.  At this point I turned around, 2 hours into my ride, and did a few hot laps around the Jack's trail network.  Super fun bombing around on those trails on a fatbike!  Rode back to town, got a lunch at the store, and stopped back to Brad's place.  I was hoping I'd get back early enough for a swim, but it was iffy given that we had dinner reservations, so I packed some clothes in a pack and headed off for the hour ride to Davo's place in Winthrop.  Had time for a shower and socializing before we headed out for dinner in town at XXXX's.  Great dinner and conversation as usual.
