Thought this was going to be a short intro to Mazama, but I guess I was wrong.  Started off with a short flat, followed by a fairly steep 1500 foot climb, and 1700 foot decent.  Was feeling pretty good on the climb, hanging toward the back but I was a bit fatigued from travel, a full day of cooking and sorting gear.  On the flat after the decent I started feeling like total crap.  I kept going, as I didn't want to loose the group, though I was riding really slowly and falling further and further behind.  Finally, we dropped out of single track onto a road, and there was no sign of the rider before me.  I took that opportunity to sit on a tree stump and rest for a few minutes.  After that, I started feeling much better, and started riding at a regular pace.  Quickly found 3 stragglers from the group, and we motored back down the community trail ( flat) back to home.  Got my 3rd best time ( of only 4 times having ridden that trail :P).  Arrived home to a great feast of pulled pork, ribs, beans, coleslaw and cornbread.  I had done all of the baking, and most of the work for the beans ealier in the day.  Brownies for desert, which I also baked.   Great meal and great company!
