Cutthroat Lake Hike

Got a leasurely start and met at the store for a second breakfast or caffiene topper.  Drove out to the Cutthroat lake trailhead, and started down the trail.  A pretty flat one, about 2 miles to the lake.  Crossed over quite a bit of snow, then a somewhat hairy log bridge.  The bridge had shifted and was now at an angle.  Not too bad if you were careful, but a few of us opted out, as they didn't feel it was worth the risk.  Just a bit past the bridge we reached the lake, stunning views.  Stopped for lunch, then headed back to meet the rest of the group.  Had a nice picnic lunch with bread, cheese, humus, olives, chocolate.  After a bit headed back, then back to the store for afternoon coffee.  Checked about the possibility of renting a fat bike for the day, then back to the house for some rest.

Dinner time!  Fish tacos courtesy of El Chefe!  We had a bunch of margaritas, with a half gallon of fresh lime juice as well.  Great music, someone put on the Johnny Cash station, which started with some Drive by Truckers (My suite antoinette).  Been a while since I listened to that, but it is great music.  Segued to Crazy, then a bunch of Johnny.  Later we switched to the Talking Heads channel, which kicked off with "this must be the place"  Lots of fun and laughing.  Someone suggested saving your bullets on the next day's climb, which was going to be a big one.  I quipped that at this point, I was only shooting blanks ;)
